By default, debian versions prior to bookworm do not come pre-installed with proprietary harware blobs.
Ex: Missing gpu and network adapter drivers

It is recommended to start the installation process of debian with a LAN connection as this will enable
you to download a Desktop Environment on a bare minimun debian iso install.

Here are some of the following steps in installing proprietary firmware on your machine:

Method 1: Using firmware available on the official repository
	Firstly, find which devices are missing their firmware (You can check devices available using
	the lspci command which lists all peripherals)

	You might want to edit the sources.list for the apt package manager and append non-free to
 	every line starting with deb to access the non-free repositories.

	Then, run the following command:
	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install firmware-linux-nonfree
	
	This will generate a new ramdisk (initramfs), essentially a temporary filesystem
	used to mount the necessary firmware during startup

	Then, reboot the system

Method 2: Installing firmware manually
	First, install the apt-file package:
	apt-get install apt-file

	Run the following commands to find the firmware required:
	apt-file update
	apt-file search --package-only /lib/firmware

	Locate the packages on the official debian site: packages.debian.org
	Install them:
	dpkg -i firmware-something.deb

Method 3: Prior to beginning the installation process, download the firmware tar.gz file from the official
	  website and extract it on the firmware directory on the installation media.
