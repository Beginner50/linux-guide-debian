My UEFI seems to be incompatible with the nvme ssd drive. The issue pertains to it not locating the
bootup files on the EFI partition or rather it not being to locate said partition.

To resolve such problem, I have to manually create a boot entry for each OS to boot from and DELETE the
automatically generated ones.
