#### Web Server
A web server is primarily responsible for handling **HTTP requests**(GET, POST and responds with the appropriate content) and serving **static content**(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, etc)

Its other responsibilities include:
- Basic routing: Routes requests to correct resources specified by URL(inside server's file system)
- Security: Provides basic security features like SSL/TLS encryption for HTTPS

Examples:
- Apache Web Server (Xampp)
- Nginx
- Microsoft IIL

#### Application Server
An application server is designed to execute **business logic**(Run application code to perform tasks such as user input, database interactions) and generate **dynamic content**(personalized web pages, API responses)

Examples:
- PHP Zend Server (Default PHP server)
- Express.js (Both a web & application server)
