Git is a version control system essential for working with changing codebases.

Terminologies:
	Upstream - This refers to the main branch from which a given branch was branched off of
		   and to which it may eventually push changes to.

		   By default, git uses "origin" as the remote name for the upstream repository.

1) To start, create a git repository and check out its status & log
	git init
	git status
	git log

2) It is advisable to link this local repository to a remote one (e.g github repo)
	git remote add origin [githubURL]

3) Then synchronise by pulling the contents of that remote repository
	git pull origin

   If your branch is not up-to-date with the upstream and you have made some changes
   you want to keep, then stash those changes and then pull from upstream.
	git stash
	git pull origin
	git stash pop

4) Alternatively, if the local repository already has some history,
	git push -u origin [branchToBePushed] --force

   	The -u flag sets the upstream for the branch so that later you can
	push without specifying the remote repository again.

        Be aware that the --force flag will overwrite the remote git
	repository.

5) Files need to be added and commited for them to be saved as a version
	git add . && git commit -m "messageHere"

6) Update the remote repository with the files from the local one
	git push origin main

7) It is better to create a new branch when working with multiple git users in
   a single repository.
	git branch [branchName] [Optional: commitHash]

8) To navigate to the branch created
	git switch [branchName]

9) To navigate back to the branch before checkout out another branch
	git switch -

10) Delete an unwanted branch using
	git branch -d [branchName]

    To delete a remote branch:
	git push origin --delete [remoteBranchName]

11) In case you made a commit & forgot to include an important file/change,
    add it to stage and then run:
	git commit --amend

    This will update the last commit by adding the stashed changes. However, you will have to run some
    additional commands to push to the upstream repository.

	git reflog

    This will give you the hash value for the amended and old commits, which will be denoted as new and old
    respectively.

  	git checkout old && git merge -s ours old
  	git merge main
  	git push . HEAD:main
  	git switch -
  	git push origin

12) To list the git log as a graph:
	git log --graph -all --decorate --oneline

13) To set up a git command alias
	git config --global alias.[aliasName] "aliasCommandHere"

14) To merge a branch
	git merge [branchName]
	git merge --abort

    The second command aborts the merge in case of a conflict

15) If you want to contribute to another repository, you need to first fork it, clone the forked repo, create a 
    separate branch, commit changes in the branch, push it upstream to forked remote and then create a pull request
    on github. 

16) Assuming that you have already made a commit to the local repo before detecting new commits from upstream, then
    you need to rebase your new commit(s) on top of the ones from the remote.

	git pull --rebase
 
    If a merge conflict is detected, resolve them and continue
	git rebase --continue
