Dual booting windows with linux can cause the local time to be out of sync.

This problem can arise when the OSes confuse what time is stored in the BIOS clock. Linux considers it as UTC whilst windows considers it as local time
(UTC+4).

Dual booting can mess up the local time on both systems; hence, it is important
to synchronise both system's interpretation of the information in the
BIOS clock.

The following can be done by first adjusting the time on the linux machine
to local time and then running the command:

	timedatectl set-local-rtc 1
