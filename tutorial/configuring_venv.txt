I have managed to get shebang to work in python:

1) Add the virtual environment path to the shebang like so:
   #!/home/prashant/Desktop/Pygame_basics_1/.venv/bin/python3.10

2) Now, the python script should NOT be run with python as using python
   in bash defaults to it using the global interpreter path, which is
   unwanted as we need to use the symlink instead

3) Instead, elevate the status of the python script like so:
   chmod +x main.py

4) Then, run the script
   ./main.py
