Nginx is primarily used as an http server to serve http requests from other
hosts within the same subnetwork.

To install nginx:
	sudo apt install nginx-full

To enable and run nginx service:
	sudo systemctl enable nginx
	sudo systemctl start nginx

Edit html pages in directory: /var/www

Then create a text file named nginxweb within /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
directory:
	sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/nginxweb

Copy paste the following in the file & replace public ip with your actual ip
address:

server {
       listen 80;
       listen [::]:80;      
       server_name www.example.com example.com;
       server_name <your_public_IP>; 
      root /var/www/nginxweb;
       index index.html;       location / {
               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
}

To disable nginx:
	sudo systemctl stop nginx
	sudo systemctl disable nginx
