To maximise battery life for linux, the following tools are needed
	powertop
	tlp tlp-rdw

1) Install tlp and tlp-rdw since powertop is already installed by default
	sudo apt install tlp tlp-rdw

2) Start the tlp service
	sudo tlp start

3) Optionally, you can configure the tlp config at /etc/tlp.conf and run tlp
start to load new configs.

4) Callibrate your battery with powertop (Screen might turn off/dim in the
process)
	sudo powertop --calibrate

5) Disable the dedicated GPU through powertop by opening powertop and
navigating to the tunable section. There, toggle the PCI device for your
graphics card.

Warning: You have to manually re-enable GPU if you want to use the GPU
