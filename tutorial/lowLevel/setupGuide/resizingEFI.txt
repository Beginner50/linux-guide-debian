The EFI partition holds the bootloaders for operating systems as well as
critical system utilites and applications that can be run from the UEFI
firmware.

	E.g Firmware drivers (system utilities) & grubx64.efi (bootloader)

Sometimes the EFI partition needs to be resized to accomodate new OSes.
Unfortunately, it cannot be resized and will have to be recreated instead.

Step 1: Back up the contents of the EFI partition after mounting it
	
	sudo mount /dev/nvmen1p1 /mnt
	sudo rsync -av /mnt ~

Step 2: Unmount the EFI partition at /boot/efi

Step 3: Open parted (Or gdisk which is more cumbersome)
	
	sudo parted /dev/nvmen1

Step 4: Note down the start and end (optional) sectors
	
	unit s print

Step 5: Recreate the EFI partition
	
	rm 1 (where 1 is the EFI partition)
	mkpart primary fat32 2048s endSector
	set 1 esp on
	exit

Step 6: Format the EFI partition before restoring data on it
	
	sudo mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvmen1p1

Step 7: Find the UUID of the EFI partition and modify /etc/fstab accordingly

	sudo blkid | grep EFI
	sudo vim /etc/fstab

Optional: Mount the EFI partition and check its size using
	df -h --out=size /mnt
