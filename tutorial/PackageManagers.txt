Package Managers:

-apt and apt-get:
	apt and apt-get have similar functionality.
	However, apt is often more extensive than apt-get and it is
  	therefore recommended to use apt instead of apt-get

	Detailed Descriptions:
	  apt:
	    No information available but essentially a superior version
	    of apt-get.

	  apt-get:
	    apt-get is a command line interface for retrieval of packages
 	    and information about them from authenticated sources and
	    for installation, upgrade and removal of packages together
            with their dependencies.

Installing Third Party Packages (deb or PPA):

	-PPA: PPA is an acronym for Personal Package Archive

	   PPA are third party repositories that are not part of the
	   official repositories.

	  1) To add a PPA repository, run the following command:
		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:[name of PPA] 

	  2) To install a third party package from that PPA:
		sudo apt update   {searches for latest package updates}
		sudo apt install [PPA Package]

	  3) To remove a package and its corresponding PPA:
		sudo remove [package name]
		sudo add-apt-repository -remove ppa:[name of PPA]


	-deb: deb stands for debian executables

	   debian executables are third party packages that can be
	   installed from the web

	      1) INSTALLATION
	        A) UBUNTU
		sudo apt deb ./[path to debian file]

		NOTE: It is important to specify ./ or else
		      the package will be installed from the web.

		B) DEBIAN
		sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
		sudo apt install -f

	      2) REMOVAL
		Removing a debian package is cumbersome.

		This involves searching for the package:
	   	sudo dpkg -l | grep "PackageName"

		Then, delete the package along with its dependencies:
		sudo dpkg --purge PackageName

		Run the apt autoremove command:
		sudo apt-get autoremove
		sudo apt-get autoclean

		For additional cleanup, remove the Package's etc file:
		sudo rm -rf /etc/PackageName


Method 2: Installing second-and-third party repositories:
	Configure the /etc/apt/sources.list file with root privileges and add the repository of your choice.
	
	Consult the debian unofficial repositories website for more info

Method 3: Using AppImage
	AppImage are universal and convenient way of installing and running applications on linux.

	Essentially, they are a compressed image with all the dependencies and libraries needed to run
	the software; implying that they can be run on any distribution

	They also offer security benefits as they do not require root privileges to execute and are thus
	safer than the conventional apt install commands.

	See https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/ for more information on AppImages

	-Usage:
		Change the permission of the AppImage, chmod +x sample.appimage
		Run i, ./sample.appimage
	
	
	-Removing:
		Removing an appimage is also simple, simply remove the AppImage
