This information is dedicated for machines with AMD GPUs although some of the knowledge may
be applied to NVIDIA GPUs as well.

1) Using a dedicated GPU
	DRI_PRIME=1 {file}

 	Note: Be sure to re-enable the PCI Device for the GPU through powertop before running the command.

2) Monitoring
   For monitoring, it is recommended that you install the radeontop package as well as mesa-utils.
   The radeontop package simply monitors the usage of the AMD GPU

	sudo apt install radeontop mesa-utils

   Then, open radeontop and run glxgears in another terminal using the dedicated graphics processor
