Environment variables can be accessed system-wide

PATH: The PATH environment variables allow execution of files system wide using only their filenames
      Any files (executable files) which lie in a directory that is included in the PATH
      environment variable can also be executed using only their filenames.

      (P.S. Make sure the file is a valid executable and has executable permission on)

      Use Case: Custom commands such as Neofetch are stored in the /usr/bin directory
	        which is included in the PATH

		This makes it accessible system-wide

      Or, the PATH can also be modified to include a directory/file outside those
      already listed in the path

      To add a directory to the PATH,
	export PATH=$PATH:/your/new/path/here
	
      To remove a directory from the PATH:
	ALWAYS ADD NEW PATH AT THE END OF THE ORIGINAL PATH TO MAKE IT EASIER TO
	REMOVE.
	export PATH=[PATH without the paths you want to remove]
