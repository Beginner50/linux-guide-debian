1) Install VNC viewer in the android device
2) Install a VNC server software on your laptop (x11vnc)
3) Set up a password:
    x11vnc -storepasswd PASSWORDHERE /etc/x11vnc.pass
4) Start the vnc server
    x11vnc -display :O
5) On the android device, add the ip address of the VNC server/ host machine
    along with port 5900
    
Note: This method has some flaws; the main one being that it consumes bandwidth
      and the second one is that it is difficult to use.
