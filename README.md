# linux-guide-debian
A collection of Linux guides I compiled along my journey of learning Linux systems and Git. Although, the guides have been written with my computer system in mind, most of these will be applicable to any Linux distribution and the underlying system architecture. They are mainly references and not comprehensive explanations on any particular topic.


## Disclaimer
Do keep in mind that this is a personal project of mine. While I try to maintain the accuracy of all information in this repository in so far as Linux/Git knowledge is concerned, I cannot guarantee that all of them will be accurate/up-to-date.


## How to use?
If you are new to Linux, you might better start off by watching some youtube videos on what GNU/Linux is and some common terminologies associated with Linux. Then, start learning from websites such as linuxjourney like I did. Then, as you tinker with your Linux system, you can come back to this repository to find out how I solved or found ways around obscure problems.

Otherwise, if you require some specific knowledge, then the contents of the sub-directories may be of some interest to you.
